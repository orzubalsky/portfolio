        A recorded investigation recounts events that occurred in Israel and Palestine in 2012 regarding the motion of celestial bodies, the movement of rocks on the ground, and undercover security forces at protests. A voice describes fragments of the events, a rock emanates static radio sound, and a wall is beating with what changes from the sound of heartbeats to the sound of far away gunshots.

        On March 3rd 2015, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to the U.S. to speak before congress about nuclear negotiations between U.S. and Iran. In what is criticized as a political stunt just prior the elections in Israel, Netanyahu followed his pattern of fear mongering and diverting attention from his own failures.
      </p>
      <p>
        We recognize that both the speech itself as well as the controversy surrounding it put aside the pressing issues of the occupation in Palestine, from social inequality to racism and injustice. As a way to protest Netanyahuâ€™s visit to Congress, we invited the public to imagine the speech that they would like the Israeli Prime Minister to give and perform it themselves.

        The title of the series is taken from an introduction to a poem by Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano, asking to "set our sights beyond the abominations of today to divine another possible world." We ask to turn the impossibilities embedded in this political spin into the possible.
